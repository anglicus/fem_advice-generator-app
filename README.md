## My process


### Built with

HTML, SCSS and Javascript

### What I learned

Learned a bit about loading external data in Javascript using Fetch, in particular how to configure Fetch to reload new data instead of keeping what's in the cache:

````
fetch('https://api.adviceslip.com/advice', {cache: "reload"})
````

### Continued development

I want to continue developing front-end capabilities.
